Convert raw user description and API context into an implementation-ready specification.
Make sure we provide a functional web app that meets the user requirements.
Be concise and clear in your documentation.
There is no database available for this project.
We have an existing Farcaster miniapp (Frame v2) template to work with.
We need to customize the template in form and function to meet the user requirements.

Farcaster is a decentralized social network built on Ethereum, emphasizing user data ownership and interoperability. Each user connects their Ethereum wallet, ensuring secure identity verification and seamless integration with blockchain-based applications. Ôøº

Developers can leverage Farcaster‚Äôs open protocol to create innovative applications. The platform offers various tools and APIs to facilitate this process. For instance, the Farcaster-py SDK allows developers to programmatically interact with the Farcaster network using Python, enabling tasks such as posting messages, retrieving user information, and more. Ôøº

Additionally, Farcaster supports the development of ‚Äúframes,‚Äù which are mini-apps that run inside a Farcaster feed. These frames enable rich, interactive experiences without requiring users to leave their social feed. Frameworks like Frog have been developed to simplify the creation of these frames, providing a minimal footprint and utilities for common tasks. Ôøº

Farcaster‚Äôs architecture includes Hubs, which are distributed servers that store and validate data. Developers can run their own Hubs to gain real-time access to Farcaster data, enhancing the decentralization and resilience of the network. Ôøº

The platform‚Äôs integration with blockchain technology ensures that user data is secure and tamper-proof. By leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs capabilities, Farcaster provides a censorship-resistant environment where users maintain control over their social interactions. Ôøº

For more detailed information on building with Farcaster, including tutorials and API documentation, developers can refer to the official Farcaster documentation.Ôøºhttps://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/

## User Requirements
Subject: Create a Simple Tapping Game App with FID Entry for ü•ú Peanuts

Hello EasyApp AI,

I want to create a mobile app for my project with the following features:

App Name: Nuts Collector

Core Functionality:
- Tapping Interface: Users should see a large ü•ú emoji in the center of the screen.
- Tapping Action: When a user taps the ü•ú emoji, they should receive one virtual peanut.
  - Cooldown: After tapping, there should be a 10-minute cooldown before they can tap again to receive another peanut.
- Counter Display: Show the current number of peanuts collected by the user on the screen.
- Visual Feedback: Each time a peanut is successfully collected, give some visual feedback like a brief animation or a small pop-up message saying "You've collected 1 ü•ú!"

FID Entry:
- Sign-Up Option: 
  - Allow users to sign up by entering their Farcaster FID number manually.
  - This should be a simple input field where users can type their FID.
- Display User Info:
  - Once an FID is entered and confirmed, display this FID number in the app interface (e.g., at the top of the screen or in a profile section).
- Data Management:
  - Store the entered FID number locally on the device for quick access.
  - Keep peanuts count associated with the FID so that it's persistent across sessions.

Additional Features:
- UI for FID Input: 
  - Include a "Sign Up" or "Enter FID" screen with an input field for the FID number.
  - Maybe include a button like "Submit FID" to confirm the entry.
- Simple UI: Keep the UI clean and minimalistic, focusing on the tapping experience. 
  - Background: Use a light, nut-friendly color (e.g., beige or light brown).
  - Font: Use a clear, readable font for the counter and FID display.
- Notifications: Optionally, notify users when the cooldown is over, and they can tap again to collect another peanut.

Security and Privacy:
- Data Storage: Only store the FID number locally on the device. No personal data collection beyond the FID is needed.

Performance:
- The app should be lightweight and performant, ensuring minimal battery drain and fast response times.

Monetization (if applicable):
- No in-app purchases or ads initially, but leave the architecture open for potential future monetization strategies.

Platform:
- Create for both iOS and Android.

Please design this app to allow users to manually enter their Farcaster FID while maintaining the core functionality described. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

Thank you for creating this app for my project!

This prompt should be more feasible for a no-code platform like EasyApp AI since it doesn't require integration with external authentication APIs. Instead, it just involves storing and displaying a number entered by the user. However:

- Ensure Clarity: Make sure the user understands that the FID they enter should be their real Farcaster FID for consistency across devices or app reinstalls.
- Validation: You might want to add a simple validation check (e.g., FID numbers are numbers only and within a certain range) if EasyApp AI supports such logic
